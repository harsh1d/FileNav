Hello, I'm Anas ðŸ‘‹

I built this to challenge myself, so I decided to stay within the context of using only SplitText and ScrambleText plugins.

It's just a hero section for now, something simple but open to further optimization later.

More than anything, I hope this can inspire someone else to build their own version.

Honestly, it didnâ€™t take long to make â€” big thanks to GSAP and Webflow for making GSAP free to everyone.

Enjoy the code!
